# deck-of-cards

April 25th

**Code Kata** - create a deck of cards, then shuffle them

Output is

> > Diamond - 8  
> > Spade - King  
> > Heart - 3  
> > Diamond - 5  
> > Club - 6  
> > Spade - 10  
> > ...

While this can be solved in two lines, this was the solution that I came up with on the spot. (I did have to look up the LINQ shuffle, obviously)

I'm pretty proud of myself for populating a deck instead of writing out every card by hand.
